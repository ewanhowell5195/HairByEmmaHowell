  "intro": "<h1>About Me</h1><p>Hi, I’m Emma! A dedicated and experienced hairdresser with over 16 years in the industry. I work from my warm and friendly home salon in Row Town, Surrey, where I offer a full range of hair services – from cuts and colours to special occasion styling and bridal hair. I absolutely love what I do, and nothing makes me happier than seeing a client leave with a smile on their face and a boost of confidence.</p>",
  "extra": "<p>Hairdressing has always been more than just a job for me – it’s a creative outlet and a way to connect with people. I genuinely enjoy getting to know each of my clients and creating styles that suit their personality, lifestyle, and vision. I have a particular passion for bridal hair and feel honoured to be part of someone’s big day – helping them feel beautiful and relaxed is incredibly rewarding.<br><br>Making people feel good about themselves is the heart of what I do, and I look forward to welcoming you to my salon soon.</p>",
