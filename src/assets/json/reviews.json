She listened carefully to the style I wanted and never made me feel like I was asking too much, even with my request for a more time-consuming colour trend!\n\nThe results were absolutely beautiful, exactly as I envisioned. Emmaâ€™s patience, attention to detail, and professionalism truly set her apart. I will definitely be returning and highly recommend her services!",

She is friendly, professional, takes the time to understand what you want to achieve and is very mindful of your time; great for fitting in a quick hair cut in your lunch break! She has cut and coloured my hair, as well as curled it for recent weddings Iâ€™ve attended, and Iâ€™m always blown away by what she is able to achieve.",

I had a full head of balayage highlights, a toner, a cut and a bouncy blowdry - the whole shabang! I showed her pictures of my desired style and she matched them exactly. I couldnâ€™t recommend her more ! 10/10 experience",
